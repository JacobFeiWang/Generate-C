Generate-C

Embedded C-code generation DSL. The intention of this package is to provide a
reasonably typesafe way to generate C code from within Haskell. It uses
Haskell's type inference so that you do not always have to provide explicit
types for your C code and also makes sure that the programs generated are type
correct.  The package does not support the full C language. If you feel that
something is missing, please send a patch or ask me nicely.
